# Reviews & Metrics for Software Improvements

## Monitoring Issues

Measure progress, productivity, and quality of a work product

* velocity
* code walkthroughs
* requirements technical reviews

## Skipped Metrics

* Many software projects avoid measuring
* developers time poor
* lack of industry standards
* ineffective metrics - lines of code loc

## Goal, Question, Metric (GQM)

goals are usually used to improve objects - examples - work products such as code or documentation

* metrics should be computational
* objective
* intuitive
* consistent in terms of metrics and dimenions
* Provide an effective mechanism for improving software quality

## Daily Scrum
* velocity
  * number of units completed in interval - story points
  * ideally development team has worked on similar issues in the past, helps estimate velocity
* release burn down
  * work completed, work left to finish
  * can also use iteration burn down charts
