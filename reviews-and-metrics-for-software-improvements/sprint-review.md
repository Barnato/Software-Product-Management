# Sprint Review

* Product owner - product backlog
* sprint describes interactions
* sprint review vs sprint retrospective
* sprint review - product is demoed
* sprint retrospective - team's process is reviewed
* get feedback
* scrum events are time boxed
  * suggested time is one hour for each week of the Sprint
  * sprints are month long - sprint reviews should be four hours
* should be little prep for sprint review - demo of working product as is
* scrum masters - scheduled time box
  * conversations stay on track
* development team will normally run the meeting
* product owner approves features, checks that the team is following overall product vision

* Sprint review meeting is composed of:

  * Product demo - should be as realistic as possible, appropriate format, e.g., if mobile app should be mobile
live demo, not hard coded and
meet team's definition of done,
feature are coded, documented and tested
  *  Product Owner approval - approves features from product backlog, then it is removed from product backlog, or product owner may need additional time to approve product

* Stakeholder feedback:
  * suggest features
  * praise that the product is on right track
- or suggest new problems
  * stakeholders are free to suggest new features, up to determine by product owner if these features get developed
* but should not add new features in middle of sprint, during sprint review might be appropriate time to suggest new features
