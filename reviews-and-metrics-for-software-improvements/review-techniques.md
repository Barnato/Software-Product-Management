# Review Techniques

* find defects early, less expensive
* reviews internal to dev
* peer reviews - formal to informal
* software walk through - dev - small audience - tour of code (see [product walkthrough guide](https://userguiding.com/blog/product-walkthroughs/))
* software technical review - more review, 3 roles:
  * decision maker - work is being reviewed, determining goals
  * review leader - review is orderly
  * recorder - documenting issue
* set of recommendations is the output - resolve ambiguities, improve product as a whole
