# Defect Analysis

* Number of defects in code compared to number of bugs fixed

* Tabulate number of errors in state

* Number of bugs found per week vs fixed per week

* Ratio creating new features vs fixing bugs

* If new bugs found more than bugs fixed focus more time on fixing found bugs

* Track rate of bugs found vs fixed to see internal quality of product

* Hopefully as product goes on less new product defects and more bugs getting found

* Software barrier - product not ready to be released

* Defect analysis = current status of quality of product

* Fixed defect sub system

* Number of fixed defects for each sub system

* Defect density - number of defects whole product has

* Ratio of defects relative to size of code

* If defect density is going up - not ready to release your product

* Shuttle group process - find defect, but not enough - look for other areas the defect could occur, adjust the process to avoid similar bugs in future
