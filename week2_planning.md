# Week 2

## Planning

Who should do work and time estimates

more specifics tasks easier time estimates

risk of over commiting to client

estimates and schedules

developers know how to develop features (time)

software PM also has idea of time

client do not normally have a say in time estimates

create plans for what needs to be done and who needs to complete it

Missing deadline

keep plan on track

Project: communication app on spacecraft

risks identified

develop risk plan with people who may be impacted

planning - anticipate problems

what are examples of some things that could go wrong

what if technology crashes

Reacting to problem in heat of moment not helpful

Looking risks when start development
