Sucess + Agile

SPM - sucess - schedule, budgets, and client reqs

another factor - developer satisifaction?

without them there is no product

post release bugs, post release support, client satisfaction

good idea, business model, timing, good development timeframe

timing - the product is needed/wanted by customers

Agile - project develops at steady sustainable rate

frequest testing to reduce budgets

frequent communication with client

success is not final, failure need not be fatal

iterations. Software changes.

Project success is walking a path.
