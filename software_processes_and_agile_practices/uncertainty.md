* Know exactly what you are producing and how your team will do so

* Requirements and methods for implementation change

* Uncertainty graph: Y - what are you developing and X - how are you developing

* Requirements change or get added

* Want to have **low uncertainty** for ends and means

* Adhoc development- make up product as you go

* Define majority of requirements before deciding how to complete them. Then solution is considered

* Then requirements will change and solutions will change

* Hopefully get to place where software product ends and development means have low uncertainty

* [See cone of uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_of_Uncertainty) on wikipedia
