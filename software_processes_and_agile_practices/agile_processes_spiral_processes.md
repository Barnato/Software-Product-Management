# Agile Processes

## Spiral models

interative

repeating stages of Processes

each loop back is an interactions

for runner to agile processes, but also sequential

so kinda waterfall?

Spiral - revisit phrases after

completion

4 quadrants

activities


1) objectives and needs for current interactions
2) risks and solutins
3) testing current interactions

then plan next interaction

risk data - time activities based on risk

cons: difficult to make estimates
minimize risk - requires analytical expertize
to know how much time is too little/too much
