# Agile Processes

## Prototyping

* Illustrative - drawings on napkin. Share an idea, disposable.

* Explorative - look and feel. Expensive. Product developers want to see if product can work. How useful.

* Throwaway - second version?

* Incremental - start with working type.....add to it....triage system. Asess each of the system's components.

* Evolutionary - carry through to final product. Each incremental product is working. Develop product from ground up.Most important to least important. Ratings: Features, much be done, should be done (not critical), could be done

* Messaging app - add profile picture, intial path of photo, in another protoype developer lets user choose drop down images, then later drag and drop. Feature rich and robost.
