# 2.4.2: Kanban

Just in time manufacturing - everything is done at the last moment before it is needed

One thing at a time

Pull method - vacant spot.

Bin empties

Pull from a later process. When applied to all activities. Insight into state of system. When and where.

Track when each phrase of when manufacturing is complete.

Pulling components

What is needed when and where

Piece of work - each phrase of manufacturing

Mobile app connected to database

Create a functioning prototype of the mobile app without connecting databaseâ€¦.

Then add advanced features later

Build advanced features later

Discover flaws early in design

If build entire product - basic features might not have been needed

In Kanban all phrase coordinated

Bottleneck - where less work can be completed. Could increase resources.

But you could also reduce work done before.

Limit work in progress. Work in progress limits.

Limit amount of work that must be done in place

Cycle time is the key metric in Kanban

Cycle time in each phrase.

Kanban - backlog is always in order

Kanban - alongside software development

Just in time development is followed
