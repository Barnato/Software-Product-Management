Problems

* Misinterpretation

* Software built incorrectly

three day weather foresact?

or

daily weather for next three days and then stops?

* Have conversations with stakeholders

* Categories of problematic words

* 11 categories of words rest are problematic

* They can lead to misinterpretation:
  * indirect words - should
  * vague words - processed
  * persuasion words - certainly
  * completion words
  * qualifiers - every
  * comparatives
  * quantities
  * pronouns
  * positional words - after
  * temporal words - when
  * joining words - or, both
