# Requirement Activities

wants are desired functions a client would like to see in a product

needs are core functions the product needs to solve the problem the product was intended to solve

requirements elicitiation - what is needed by customer vs what the client wants

prirotize end user first (what the user will do with the product to solve the problem) not interface design

specification phrase - elicitiation

requirements expression - getting needs into a useable form

textual, graphical, simplistic

break down further into what must be done, should be done, could be done

plan and estimate those requirements

are they clean, clear and consistent

make sure that they don't clash

scrum:
* requirements elicitiation
* requirements expression
* product backlog
* requirements priroritization
* requirements management - developers need to refer to them in their logs, tests etc

if requirements change need to know impact on other requirements
