# Involving client

* Do requirements elicitation alot
* Don't just do requirements gathering - interact with the client.
* Don't rely on client, also interview end users to see what they want. See product manual if use to another kind of product, feasibility study.
* Label requirements with a unique identifier. Create a glossary for the product to help interactions with the client.

Requirements Elicitation:

1. Meet with client
1. Get a list. But just just use client list as the quality may not be good. Propose different solutions.
1. Ask client to prioritize
1. Add to backlog of requirements

## How to talk to client

Make sure you ask client open ended questions
and stay indepent of technology if possible
Why?
  * Why do you want that product?
  * Why would anyone use it?
