# Estimates, Targets, and Commitments

* I estimate we can commit to a certain target date.

* **An estimate - how long development team to complete a task.**

* Estimates should be a range - can't give precise date.

* Estimates should not be negotiable.

  Examples:

  Product manager approaches developer, how long to develop feature, thinks take 3 hours if works hard. Pad estimate so she can relax. PM says only 3 hours but splilts the differece. Not good. Should be accurate and based on prior work. Could estimate between 3 to 9 hours.

  PM says 5 hours to write tests for a feature. Dev says it will take 10 hours. Dev took 6 hours to write test for a similar feature. Most accurate time estimate would be 6 hours.

* Target - point in schedule to meet. Should not be negotiated. End of sprint is an example of an example. Target dates - product promotions.

* *Commitments* are where negotiations happen. How do I compromise on what dev team will do based on time estimates and targets?

* Release date is *target*.

* What you can negotiate is what you can commit to for the scope of the project. Keep commitment, estimates, and targets seperate.

* Streams of work. Multiple projects being interdependent and roll up into an overall schedule help project managers.
