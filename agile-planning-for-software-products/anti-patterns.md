Anti-patterns

* Development team gets stuck in the specification phrase

  * Management can’t decide which direction the product should go in - you don’t need to know all information up front - can do incremental releases - this is in the spirit of agile

* Cart before the horse
  * developers are pulled away from building critical features to build non critical features
* Need to focus in doing a few and high priority requirements

* Group think
  * follow opinions of group even if you disagree
* Solution - break group down into different teams and have them come back with different solutions
* Have developers go off and write down solutions on paper and then regroup
