# Time estimates

* cone of uncertainty

  ![variability-graph.png](/assets/variability-graph.png)

* cone point - less variability

* product definition

* no solution at this point

* estimates need a significant range

* variability becomes smaller as product features are known, smaller vertical intervals

* arch design and detailed design estimates more reliable

* multiple time by variability points to get range

* estimates should be based on some kind of estimate

* 1 method - bottom up approach - break project into tasks - pro - based on estimates for small tasks so less uncertainty, but con - estimates for task may be not based on actual data

* 2nd method - Analogy technique
 estimate using experience with similar project

 * 3rd methods - get estimates from multiple experts - issue with this is just because your project is similar doesn't mean your project doesn't have unique challenges
