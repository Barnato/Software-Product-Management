# Work breakdown structure

* Breakdown building an application into manageable tasks

* Code, test, operations and marketing

* Development team

* Phrases > activities > tasks

* Breakdown project

* Making an application
* Work break down into work products

* Smaller work products

* Small so work product is clear enough to be assigned to one person

* WBS - break down tasks into work products

* Donâ€™t break down too much because that leads to micro management

* Example:
  * Video game
    * Appropriate work product = one person can do the night sky scene

* News application = content, UI, graphics, documentation

* Another example of a work product: layout design, unit tests, acceptance tests

* Examples of tasks: write unit tests for embedded widgets

* smaller projects - estimate to the minutes
* bigger projects - estimate to weeks or months
