# Anti-patterns - teams

* Can be good to spilt up groups into teams
* but risk of silos - break down in communicatiom
* developers don't communicate other teams
* create products in a vacum
* have flat management to encourage communicatiom
* different development teams using management to communicate with each other about product v inefficent and counter productive
* other anti-pattern - vendor lockin
* rely on one *technology/vendor*
  * problem if one day the technolgy does not cover your needs
  * example: vendor had a proprietory programming langauge. Org forced to use the other tools this org provided
  * To avoid do lots of research before settling on one option, the product you like could have problems or there might be other products.
  * over engineering and gold plating:
    * over engineering (product more complex than it needs to be)
    * Example user interface with too many speculative features e.g., basic photo editors that offer lots of custimizations before showing your image
    * gold plating - effort into project beyond point of return
    * stop working when the product functions well
    * user studies to see if the interface remains clear
