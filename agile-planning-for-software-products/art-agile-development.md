* Programmers find it hard to estimate.

* Estimate in **real time** so you can avoid interruptions.

* Estimates are *consistently* inaccurate - devs estimates 60% of what they need per task

* Need to use estimates, targets, and commitments with velocity.

* Velocity - the number of points you can complete in one iteration.

* Velocity is effective at planning team's workload.

* don't work extra hours - undermines accuracy of Velocity.

* takes three to four iterations to be accurate.

* don't change your estimate unless you learn something new.

* pay down technical debt which has a huge impact on productivity. Can be hard though and may take months/years to be complete. Have to do it in increments.

* consider instituting no overtime policy so developers do "energized work".

* make sure customer to hand to always answer dev questions.

* adding junior programmers to a time reduces productivity. Instead do pair programming and keep teams of programmers below 10.

* should end up being able to estimate stories in a minute or two.
