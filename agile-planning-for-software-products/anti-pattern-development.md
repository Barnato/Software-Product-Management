# Anti- pattens - development


## Too little effort in a software project

  * Management practices that stop developers doing work
  * Avoid too much work to focus on over comprehensive documentation
  * Focus on high value work - working code
  * Too much focus on reports + presentations not working code
* Prototype is more informative then any documentation
* Development team should focus on coding
* Developers should not be working overtime towards the end

## Other issues

  <ins>Fire drill</ins>
* Fire drill - leads to poor coding
* Not working enough during earlier parts of the project or bad management so developers have to work a lot of over time at the end to get the project done.

<ins>Heroics</ins>

* one developer with great technical skills to get project done on time
* Better for everyone to work at a steady pace

* Death march - developers know project is doomed to fail - if developers donâ€™t believe in the product inevitable the prodcut will fail
