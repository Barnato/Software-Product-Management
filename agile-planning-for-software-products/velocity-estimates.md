## <ins>Can't use velocity to compare teams</ins>

## Use alternative metrics to preserve culture

* cycle time - work statred to work delivered
* iteration churn:
  * number of changes to scope in a team iteration.
  * Switching context is particularly costly for knowledge workers
* rework ratio - churn within a feature or product. Code rewritten within 3 weeks of merging. Means features are poorely defined.

Number of new bugs should go down.
