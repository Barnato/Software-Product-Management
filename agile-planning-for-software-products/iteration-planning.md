# Iteration planning

* Iteration plans are important to avoid developers under or over commiting.

* Scrum and XP use iteration plans.

* Meetings should be timed boxed:

  * the length of the meeting is fixed at the beginning of the meeting and needs to be adhered to
  * four hours good for sprint planning
  * sprint goal should be established at the beginning of the sprint meeting
  * project velocity in the last sprint will determine what you commit to in this sprint
  * use lowest velocity from previous sprint if last sprint velocity was abnormal and not reflective of your team's actual development pace
  * do all user stories planned for this sprint and any not completed in last sprint that were supposed to be completed
  * these incomplete stories are those that did not meet your teams definition of done or user stories that failed to pass acceptance tests
  * user stories are broken down into developer tasks
  * developer tasks should be small enough to be completed in a day or two
  * As a user I want to put infomation into a database:
    * designing the database
    * developing the database
        * input field on the user interface
        * creating documentation for this feature
        * writing tests for this feature / testing the feature
        * express these tasks e.g., Kanban board
        * estimate how long each task will take
* Large tasks that will take more than *three* days should be broken down into smaller tasks
* It is important that developers **self** assign tasks (that they are interested in and have time for) not management. Results in happier developers.
