<ins>Signs of micromanagement:</ins>
* giving unsolicited advice to teams
* asking to be cc ed on all project emails
* constantly focused on how the project can fail
* email as a primary form of communication is anti - pattern. It is too formal for some, easy to misinterpret, no context.
* Need to talk to developers in person
