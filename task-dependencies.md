# Task Dependencies

* *Start-Start*, *Start-Finish*, *Finish-Start* and *Finish-Finish*.

* Start-Start - one task must start before the other can start.

* Start-Finish: first task must start before the second task can finish. So for example, during the weekly sprint - plan next sprint during current sprint.

* Finish - start - first task must finish before second task can - finish designing feature before write training manual. Most common form of dependency.

* Finish-Finish - finish billing the client before can finish building the product to ensure **compensated** for work.
