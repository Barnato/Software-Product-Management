# Agile Practices
 ## Continous delivery

 refined over time (evolutionary and incremental prototyping)

 automate build

 continous delivery - dev keeps providing it, code change, built, tested, inetgrated and released.

 construction - short iteractions, comes together in steps. Continuous delvery...automated code, best practice - write test before write code.

 Tests should eventually pass. Continous delivery practice. Fantastic advatages.

 Run tests...is part of continuous delivery. Microsoft daily build - programmers are in sync at beginning of each build. Continuous integration - when dev writes code and share it remotely, code must go through automatic testing. Daily build, catch errors before problem, can identify which piece of code is a problem.
