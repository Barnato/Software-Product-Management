# Requirements and Design

* Requirements and design

Requirements: What?

Design: How? E.g, application has to be written in Java.

In waterfall model requirements and design are completly seperate. Requirements are developed on their own.

Requirements - in a product drawing

Don't want to focus on design too early. Employs a constraint.

Product interface - client imposing click requirement. User must be using a specific input device. But if employ with mobile device they need to tap not click.

Is solution just a possible option, the only one possible, is the solution addressing the wrong problem?

Design often seeps into product.....

Avoid imposing design via requirements.
