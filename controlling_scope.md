# Controlling Scope

* Unfavourable Requirements

* Development team starts on requirments

* but client changes their mind

* development team has to change mid stream. Project can spin out of control. Degrades project Quality. End product is not likely to satsify client needs. Balance to be found between these two extremes.

* What problem does the client want to solve - product vision?

* place among competitors among the market

* Guiding principle

Example: Mobile game. You and your team say three months. Vision - creates an emersive experience. A month into development, client says becayse of VR impromenets want to develop for VR platforms. This switch is a change in product developer resources. Change in scope.

Change in scope.

vision - what can be achieved in current project

Scope is connected to vision. Scope is what can realistically be achived within the current project.

The scope drives the boundary between what is in and out of the project.

The elicitation project...avoid overpromishing on a project.

Manage expectations

Identify the capabilities that a user might expect but which you will not include in the product.

Manage expectations

Scope creep - project success lower over time:

* Ask client to prioritize requirments. Highest value...should be developed early.
* Everything has a clear start and end date
* draw scope with client
* use case
* Ask is this in scope
* Estimate time
* Average productivity of your team, sum up estimates, to see if can meet deadline

Ask about relevance of each requirement

Spend time to value implications of that change on time...but need to revised estimates

1. Define Vision
1. Scope
1. Techniques to avoid scope creep. Product boundaries, estimates, if this is in scope.
1. Requirements and design.
