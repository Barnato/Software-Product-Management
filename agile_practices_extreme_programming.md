# Agile Practices
 ## Extreme programming

 5 aspects

 * Commmunication
 * simplicity
 * feedback
 * respect
 * courage - tell truth about progess and estimates, adart to changes

 adopt xp methology

 pair programming

 * two programmers work collaboratively, immediate feedback, improves courage, programmers are more likely to take a risk if working alone

 * xp includes scrum

 * xp - 12
 Planning - large planning session about beg of dev, before each iteraction, client and dev come up with new features, user stores
 dev team have estimates for each iteration and for each user story
 when to release
 small releases
can be released early in the project
system metaphor - explain to non technical party

simple design - simple. Don't engineer design for future that may not come. Tests written before source code. Tests are executable forms of requirements. Acceptance tests - each features works as specified, large amounts of functionality. Automated or script. The second is unit tests, automated tests for low level functionality.

Refactoring: new features can be added easily. Remove duplicate and unnecessary code.

 e.g, face recognition app

 metaphor - app is like a popular person at a person who knows everyone at a party

 xp - planning should be short
 iteractions should be as small as possible but deliver a working product
 system metaphor

pair programming - two devs work side by side at a computer

code is reviewed all the time by the other person

collective code ownership - anyone can add code to any part of the product

Continuous integration - your developer combine code oftern, at least once a day. All tests should pass before integration.

40 hour work week for devs. In crunch XP allows one week of overtime. If happens more than that something wrong with Management

client is part of dev team,involved in every stage of development

all devs code to same standards. common code conventions, agreed upon at development

encourages collective ownership
