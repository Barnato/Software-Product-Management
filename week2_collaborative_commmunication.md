# Week 2

## Collaborative Commmunication

Product Managers need to allow self organizing teams.

Where to go but not how to get there.

Assigning tasks + tools should be decided by teams

devs and business people need to work daily together

product manager is a facilitator between the two parties

face to face conversation

speak directly

co-location

frequest short in person meeting

regular interviews - tunes and adjusts

important thing is process for improving your process

global corporation - airline apps
entertainment app replaces tv on planes

self organizing team:

self-assign tasks and follow certain practices (same level of respect, communication and collaboration)

more likely to notice when a non agile project is failing to meet reqs
