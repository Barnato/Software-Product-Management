# User stories

User stories should be written by client:

But often SPM does

Req = Software requirement in product:

* Invest -
  * Independent - sep from other story

  * N - negotiatable - general so can work around implementation

  * Not technically specific

  * Valuable- value to client

  * E - estimable - how long to do. If canâ€™t estimate you made an epic. Need small story
  * S = simple
  * T = testable - criteria - user tests - something to be done

Epics are usually at project beginning to describe functionality down road

Epics - Specification - phrase
