## Software Enginneering Processes

Software processes and agile processes

Lesson 1

Processes and practices

Processes organize software development into phases

Phase - lifecycle of a process

Specification - product idea and requirements
Design -
Validation and verification - design of product + implementation

Tasks include writing a piece of code and installing a library

Tasks organize activities

Work product is output of a task

Can be final output but also intermediary product - such as design, requirements, source code, test cases

Practices make processes go more smoothly

Like planning which features go into which release, estimation tasks duration, daily intervals briefing, deliver working prototype to your client every two weeks - ensure your team is delivering what client expects - validation

Process is made of phases

Phase is a group of Activities

Activities are made up of tasks

Example : creating tests is an activity
An activity is testing a guest login

Lesson 2

Software engineering activities

group of tasks
Input and output work products

Output - source code

Project management
Managing risks
Creating a process
Allocating resources
Setting standards
Performing estimations

Decide standards like coding conventions, testing strategies, def of don

Done for development team could be source code is written, documented, tested and done

Ways to minimize risk
get historical project records
Software detailed design

Then do risk plan

Estimation
Keep project schedule
Task development rate
How long it takes - task development rate
