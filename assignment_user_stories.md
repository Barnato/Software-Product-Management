# User Stories Assignment: Stanley's Problem, Part 1 (Graded)

## Project Title
User stories: Stanley's Problem - Vicky

Please provide at least three (3) user stories for Developer from the scenario above in the prescribed format:
 “As a developer, I want _____, so that _____”.
Be careful to use the correct user type (in this case, developer, not the account holder) when you are writing your user stories. Note there are certain activities that only account holders can perform.

* **As a developer, I want to get answers to questions I submit on the platform so that I can get advice on problems and questions.**

* **A​s a developer, I want to rate answers on the application negatively and positively so I can express how useful I think answers are.**

* **As a developer, I want to be able to respond to questions on the application so that I can help other developers.**

Suppose you are the product manager. Your team consists of Madison (Senior developer), Alex (Senior developer), Zoe (Developer), Sam (Developer). Stanley from the Heap Exchange is the client.
The team and the client have come up with some initial user stories of a developer. As they are reviewing them, the developers have some questions about the search feature:

Search by keywords is a bit broad and general. Since Stanley, the client, wrote this user story, the team wants him to clarify it. They ask Stanley if he wants a simple search that matches keywords with one field (e.g., question titles) only or if he wants a full-text search that matches the search criteria with question title, body, category, and author? How about searching questions under specific categories?
Stanley wants it all. To be specific, he wants a simple search functionality that matches the search criteria with both question title and body. He also wants advanced full-text search that matches all fields. Search should also work when specific categories (e.g., AI, Mobile Dev, Algorithm, etc.) are selected.

Please split the above User Story into three (3) smaller ones.

* **A​s a developer I want to search for questions based on the question title so I can find related questions based on the question title.*
* **A​s a developer I want to search for questions based on the question body so I can find related questions based on the body title.*
* **A​s a developer I want to be able to search for questions after filtering by specific categories.*

Please provide at least three (3) user stories for Account Holder from the scenario above in the prescribed format:
 “As an account holder, I want _____, so that _____”.
Be careful to use the correct user type (in this case, account holder, not the developer) when you are writing your user stories. Note there are certain activities that only account holders can perform, make sure you include them.

* **A​s an account holder, I want to ask and respond to questions so that I can recieve and provide solutions and explanations to developers.*
* **As an account holder, I want to be able to have a profile page with the ability to add an image so that I am more easily identifiable on the platform.*

As an account holder, I want to be able to have a profile page so that I can see my activity including questions I have asked or responded to on the application.


The team knows Stanley wants to “bookmark” and “watchlist” a question. However, they can’t quite tell the difference between them, so they ask Stanley to elaborate it a bit. Stanley explains that the key difference between “bookmark” and a “watchlist” is the notification - if an account holder puts a question into their “watchlist,” whenever someone answers this question, they would get a notification. In contrast, bookmarked questions are just for reference-- there’s no future action.

Given Stanely's explanation,  please write two (2) User Stories about "Bookmark" and "Watchlist" for an account holder.*

* **A​s an account holder I want to be able to visibly highlight questions so that I can easily navigate to them.*
* **A​s an account holder I want to put questions on the watchlist so that when someone answers a question I will get a notification.*
