# Agile processes

## Linear Models

can sometimes need to know about latest processes in sd to work

other times just a text editor is needed

don't always have to ignore older process, know all processes.

Need to use right processes for task.

Linear models - pattern of phases, don't repeate phases

- doesn't support looping (interative), phases should not overlap (parralels)

Waterfall - approved work product in preview phase

* not adaptable to change
* does allow devs to improve product
* can't deal with midstream changes, incorporate feedback
* client doesn't see product to end

v model - divides itself into 2 branches, v module begins with reqs
design to implmentation, model shifts to verification (each phases checks against phases on other side)
but client still doesn't see product until end.
involve client. Sawtooth model - distinguishes between client and dev. Client interactions through out to get feedback.
But doesn't address change v well.
